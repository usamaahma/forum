        Contrary to popular belief, Lore m Ipsum is not simply random text . It
        has roots
        <br /> in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
        over 2000 years old. <br /> Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
        <br /> looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from
        a Lorem <br /> Ipsum passage,
